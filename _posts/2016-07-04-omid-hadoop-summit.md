Last Wednesday we presented [Apache Omid](http://omid.incubator.apache.org/) at Hadoop Summit in San Jose. Despite
it was a post-lunch talk, there were around 45 people in the room and they asked several interesting questions at
the end. Some guys also raised the question about future plans for integration with
[Apache Phoenix](https://phoenix.apache.org/), so we will need to take a look at it.
