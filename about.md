Iâ€™m a detail-focused and result-oriented software engineer with experience in research environments. Interested mainly
-although not only- in distributed and transactional systems, I'm currently working on big data and mobile cloud
platforms & apps in a great multicultural environment. I love to learn new technologies, programming languages and
techniques, and I like to apply this knowledge in building reliable and scalable systems serving millions of people.
I'm also a contributor and committer in the [Omid](http://omid.incubator.apache.org/) project at the
[Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/).

As a research software engineer, I've developed incremental processing frameworks and other scalable services at
[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/). Also, for [Atos/BULL SAS France](http://www.bull.com/), I implemented the replication
and recovery protocols for their JEE app. server, [JOnAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOnAS). I participated in
multiple European and National (Spanish) research projects such as CumuloNimbo, ADAPT, S4All, AUTONOMIC and NEXOF. 
In all those projects, I designed and developed highly available and scalable architectures and systems; e.g. I
implemented a transaction-aware replicated cache for application servers; I open-sourced versions of 
[JEE Activity Service and WS-CAF specs](http://download.forge.ow2.org/jass/). and I built replication frameworks for
providing high-availability to stateful services. Last but not least, I've also worked as a freelance, developing a web
application in Ruby on Rails.

I got my Ph.D. from [Universidad Politecnica de Madrid](https://www.fi.upm.es/), whilst working at the Distributed
Systems Lab (LSD). My [Ph.D. Thesis]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/phd/MiddlewareForHighAvailableAndScalableMultiTierAndServiceOrientedArchitectures-FranciscoPerezSorrosal-PhDThesis.pdf)
describes protocols for the consistent replication of transactional-aware middleware. I published papers in top
conferences and journals, such as WWW, ICDCS, Middleware and VLDB Journal. During that period, I also had an internship
at [INRIA (France)](http://www.inria.fr/en/) for working on the integration autonomic computing features in my projects.

Before my time at LSD, I worked as lecturer at the Madrid Campus of the School of CS of Univ. Pontificia de Salamanca
during two academic years. There, I taught the basics of programming and operating systems to undergraduate students.
Previously, I also worked as UNIX system admin at that same university and as a quality analyst (QA) of the DB modules
of [Meta4's](http://www.meta4.com/) ERP suite.

... All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to move forward!!! :-)
